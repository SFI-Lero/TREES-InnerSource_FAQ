<h2>InnerSource FAQ</h2>
<p>Here we try to address a number of frequently asked questions about InnerSource. Most of the content is courtesy of the InnerSource Commons community: <a href="https://innersourcecommons.org/" class="uri">https://innersourcecommons.org/</a></p>
</div>
<div id="section-what-is-innersource" class="section level2">
<h2>What is InnerSource?</h2>
<p>InnerSource is the use of best practices from successful open source projects and establishment of an open source culture within your organization. You still develop proprietary software, while opening up work between developers and teams internally.</p>
<p>For a detailed description of InnerSource principles, please check out <a href="https://innersourcecommons.org/getting-started/" class="uri">https://innersourcecommons.org/getting-started/</a></p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="section-why-is-innersource-useful" class="section level2">
<h2>Why is InnerSource useful?</h2>
<p>With the increasing pace of technological change, internal communication and collaboration have become key competitive differentiators, as they are both essential to agility and ensuring long-term competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Adopting InnerSource within a organization enables reuse of existing solutions and minimizes redundancy, empowers and incentivizes collaboration across teams, and makes it possible to leverage the talent across the entire workforce.</p>

</div>
<div id="section-what-are-the-benefits-of-innersource" class="section level2">
<h2>What are the benefits of InnerSource?</h2>
<p>Many benefits that are typical of open source development can be realized with InnerSource.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Faster, with quality:</strong> Unit tests, code coverage, and continuous integration help improve code faster, producing software that is responsive and nimble to the changing needs of its many internal stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Code is better documented, both in comments and less formally in discussions.</li>
<li><strong>Code reuse:</strong> Code and architecture are discoverable and available across teams and the organization.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Friction reduced for code review, communication, and contributions in and between teams.</li>
<li><strong>Culture:</strong> Silos broken down, happiness improved and with that, better retainment and recruitment.</li>
</ul>

<div id="section-glossary-of-innersource-jargons" class="section level2">
<h2>Glossary of InnerSource jargons</h2>
<p>Various technical jargons used by the InnerSource community are listed here. This will help you understand various concepts and ideas about InnerSource.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Silos - Silos refer to developments teams that work on a specific set of projects and rarely collaborate with other teams across the company. A few key characteristics are: A lot of shorthands and undocumented conventions about the product/codebase that is known only to that team, unwillingness to collaborate with other teams and accepting new ideas, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Trusted Committer - A developer outside of the product owners who has contributed to that specific product frequently and is knowledgeable about the codebase in general. They are trusted to keep the software and the community that is developing it healthy.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-what-is-innersource-commons" class="section level2">
<h2>What is InnerSource Commons?</h2>
<p>The InnerSource Commons is a growing community of practitioners with the goal of creating and sharing knowledge about InnerSource: the use of open source best practices for software development within the confines of an organization. Founded in 2015, the InnerSource Commons is now supporting and connecting over 900 individuals from over 350 companies, academic institutions, and government agencies. You can find out more about this thriving community at <a href="https://innersourcecommons.org/" class="uri">https://innersourcecommons.org/</a></p>
</div>
<div id="section-what-are-innersource-patterns" class="section level2">
<h2>What are InnerSource Patterns?</h2>
<p>A Pattern refers to the InnerSource best practices codified in a specific format to make it easy to understand, evaluate, and apply them in your context.</p>
<p>These best practices are collected over the years but members of the InnerSource Commons community and it is likely that by looking at these patterns you will find the ideas about how to kick-start or scale your InnerSource practice.</p>
<p>The most mature (mature in this context means that each pattern has been reviewed by members of the community, and has at least one known instance where this pattern has been used) patterns have been published in the book: <a href="https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org/" class="uri">https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org/</a></p>
<p>The patterns are continually updated and new patterns are regularly added to the GitHub repository for InnerSource patterns: <a href="https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns" class="uri">https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns</a></p>
</div>
<div id="section-what-is-innersource-learning-path" class="section level2">
<h2>What is InnerSource Learning Path?</h2>
<p>The InnerSource Learning Path is a series of short training segments, each explaining one particular aspect of InnerSource. Each segment is composed of a video and corresponding written article, both of which contain the same information. Presenting that information in both written and spoken form allows people to learn in the way that is best for them. You can find the Learning Path resources at: <a href="https://innersourcecommons.org/zh/learn/learning-path/" class="uri">https://innersourcecommons.org/zh/learn/learning-path/</a></p>

<div id="section-i-have-some-concerns-about-innersource" class="section level2">
<h2>I have some concerns about InnerSource</h2>
<p>If you have some concerns regarding InnerSource or are not sure if it will be right for you/your projects, we encourage you to please take the InnerSource Obstacles Survey, which also lists various resource for addressing the most commonly faced problems. It also helps us understand what type of concerns you have so that we can address them. You can find the Survey at: <a href="https://tapjdey.shinyapps.io/HSurvey_2020/" class="uri">https://tapjdey.shinyapps.io/HSurvey_2020/</a></p>

</div>
<div id="section-is-my-project-appropriate-for-innersource" class="section level2">
<h2>Is my project appropriate for InnerSource?</h2>
<p>You can check the suitability of your project by checking the <a href="https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/master/patterns/1-initial/good-first-project.md">good-first-project</a> pattern, and the <a href="https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/master/patterns/2-structured/crossteam-project-valuation.md&#39;">cross-team project valuation</a> pattern gives insights on measuring a project’s value across different teams. You can self-evaluate the maturity of the project according to InnerSource standards using the <a href="https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/master/patterns/2-structured/maturity-model.md">InnerSource Maturity Model</a>.</p>
